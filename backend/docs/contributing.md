# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Healthcare Management System backend! This document explains how to get started, the branch strategy, and code style guidelines.

---

## 1. Getting Started
- Fork the repository
- Clone your fork and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix
- Make your changes and commit with clear messages
- Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `develop` branch

---

## 2. Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code and documentation
- `develop`: Active development branch (features, bugfixes)
- `feature/*`: Feature-specific branches (e.g., `feature/appointments`)

---

## 3. Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all backend code
- Follow existing file and folder structure
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Write modular, reusable code (use services for business logic)
- Add/extend Zod validation schemas for new endpoints
- Write clear commit messages (imperative mood, e.g., "Add patient search API")

---

## 4. Testing & Review
- Test your changes locally before submitting a PR
- PRs are reviewed by maintainers before merging
